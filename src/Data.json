He's proficient on both sides of the Flash/HTML5 argument, and is excellent not only at doing, but also demonstrating this as he was one of the best trainers and mentors I've had the pleasure of working with and watching. Kyle always makes great efforts to be on the front edge of emerging technologies and concepts, ready to learn, use and share them with those around him. Beyond the daily grind, Kyle was a true pleasure to work with, being both personable, friendly, helpful, and with a healthy dose of humor and wit, could keep the tone of the office more bearable even in the most stressful of times. To any who are interested - he would be an absolute asset from the moment he's hired."
